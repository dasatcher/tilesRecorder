## How to Install

You'll need first install both NodeJS and NPM. After installing these two system dependencies and cloning the repository, you'll need to run two commands to install the project dependencies.

From the base directory of the project, run:

npm -install

This will install all dependencies for the application. Next, run:
npm run start

This will run the application on localhost:3000

Note: Running the application requires Tiles squares as well as the Tiles gateway application.
